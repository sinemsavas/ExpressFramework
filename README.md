operation
An arithmetic operation: addition, subtraction, multiplication or division
x
First argument of an arithmetic operation
y
Second argument of the arithmetic operation
Calculates the result of each operation
It displays this result as a table

#The handler of this route, in addition to printing the output of the form: <firstNumber> <operation> <secondNumber> = <result>, is to insert into the MongoDB database three values: operation, x, and y
