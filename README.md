I developed a web application using technologies such as MongoDB, JSON, JavaScript, Pug Template, Super Test, Chai Test, and NPM scripts. The primary functionality of this application involved loading the contents of a JSON file based on the specified URL parameter. The JSON file contained information about arithmetic operations and their respective arguments, including the type of operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division), the first argument 'x,' and the second argument 'y.'

The application performed the following tasks:

Calculated the result of each arithmetic operation.
Displayed the results in a tabular format.
Additionally, the route handler for this application not only printed the results but also inserted three values - operation, 'x,' and 'y' - into a MongoDB database.
This project showcased my proficiency in working with various web technologies and my ability to create a functional web application for processing and storing data in a database.
